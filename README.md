# SOLID Principles

These principles are meant to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. They make it easy to create readable and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work with anywhere and anytime. And they make you aware of the <b>right</b> way to write code.

SOLID is a mnemonic acrynym that stands for the five design principles of Object-Oriented class design. These principles are:

- <b>S</b> - [Single Responsibility Principle.](./Single%20Responsibility%20Principle/index.md)
